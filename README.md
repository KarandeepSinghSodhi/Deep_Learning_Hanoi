# Leak Detection and Localization using 1D CNN

This repository contains the code for detecting and localizing leaks in water distribution networks using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is applied to the LeakDB (Leakage Diagnosis Benchmark) dataset.

## Dataset: LeakDB

LeakDB (Leakage Diagnosis Benchmark) is a realistic leakage dataset for water distribution networks. The dataset is comprised of a large number of artificially created but realistic leakage scenarios, on different water distribution networks, under varying conditions. A scoring algorithm in MATLAB code is provided to evaluate the results of different algorithms.

## Files

The repository contains the following Jupyter Notebook files:

1. `pre-processing finAL.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for preprocessing the LeakDB dataset.
2. `LeakDetection2-4-24.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for detecting leaks in the preprocessed dataset using a 1D CNN model.
3. `Leak Localization.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for localizing leaks in the preprocessed dataset using a 1D CNN model.
